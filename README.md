# Whats and Hows about Predictive Analysis

Predictive analysis, also known as predictive analytics, is the process of using data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques to identify patterns and make predictions about future events or outcomes. It involves analyzing historical data to uncover trends and behaviors and then using this information to forecast future outcomes.

## What is Predictive Analysis?

Predictive analysis involves using historical data to predict future outcomes or trends. It aims to answer questions such as "What is likely to happen next?" or "What is the probability of a certain event occurring?" It is used across various industries and fields, including finance, marketing, healthcare, and manufacturing, to make informed decisions, optimize processes, and mitigate risks.

## How Does Predictive Analysis Work?

1. **Data Collection:** The first step in predictive analysis is collecting relevant data from various sources. This data can include historical records, transaction data, customer information, sensor data, and more.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Once the data is collected, it needs to be cleaned and prepared for analysis. This involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.
   
3. **Feature Selection and Engineering:** In predictive analysis, selecting the right features (variables) that are most relevant to the prediction task is crucial. Feature engineering may also involve creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
   
4. **Model Building:** Predictive models are then built using statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques. These models learn from historical data to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
   
5. **Model Evaluation:** After building the models, they are evaluated using validation techniques to assess their performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
6. **Deployment:** Once a satisfactory model is selected, it is deployed into production environments to make predictions on new, unseen data. This involves integrating the model into existing systems or workflows.
   
7. **Monitoring and Iteration:** Predictive models need to be monitored regularly to ensure they continue to perform well over time. If performance degrades or new patterns emerge, the model may need to be retrained or updated.

## Types of Predictive Analysis Techniques

- **Regression Analysis:** Used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
- **Classification:** Used to predict categorical outcomes, such as class labels or binary outcomes.
- **Time Series Forecasting:** Used to predict future values of a time series based on historical observations.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple models to improve predictive performance, such as bagging, boosting, and random forests.
- **Neural Networks:** Deep learning techniques that can capture complex patterns in data for prediction tasks.

## Applications of Predictive Analysis

- Customer Churn Prediction
- Sales Forecasting
- Credit Risk Assessment
- Fraud Detection
- Predictive Maintenance
- Healthcare Diagnosis and Treatment Planning
- Demand Planning
- Personalized Recommendations

Predictive analysis has become increasingly important in today's data-driven world, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, and gain competitive advantages.

## Key Takeaways

- Industries from insurance to marketing use predictive techniques to make important decisions.
- Predictive models help make weather forecasts, develop video games, translate voice-to-text messages, make customer service decisions, and develop investment portfolios.
- Predictive analytics determines a likely outcome based on an examination of current and historical data.
- Decision trees, regression, and neural networks all are types of predictive models.
- People often confuse predictive analytics with machine learning even though the two are different disciplines.


# Types of Predictive Analytical Models

There are three common techniques used in predictive analytics: Decision trees, neural networks, and regression.

## Decision Trees

If you want to understand what leads to someone's decisions, you may find it useful to build a decision tree.

This type of model places data into different sections based on certain variables, such as price or market capitalization. Just as the name implies, it looks like a tree with individual branches and leaves. Branches indicate the choices available while individual leaves represent a particular decision.

Decision trees are easy to understand and dissect. They're useful when you need to make a decision quickly.

## Regression

This is the model that is used the most in statistical analysis. Use it when you want to decipher patterns in large sets of data and when there's a linear relationship between the inputs.

This method works by figuring out a formula, which represents the relationship between all the inputs found in the dataset.

For example, you can use regression to figure out how price and other key factors can shape the performance of a stock.

## Neural Networks

Neural networks were developed as a form of predictive analytics by imitating the way the human brain works. This model can deal with complex data relationships using artificial intelligence and pattern recognition.

Use this method if you have any of several hurdles that you need to overcome. For example, you may have too much data on hand, or don't have the formula you need to find a relationship between the inputs and outputs in your dataset, or need to make predictions rather than come up with explanations.

If you've already used decision trees and regression as models, you can confirm your findings with neural networks.

## Cluster Models

Clustering is a method of aggregating data that share similar attributes. For example, Amazon.com can cluster sales based on the quantity purchased, or on the average account age of its consumers.

By separating data into similar groups based on shared features, analysts may be able to identify other characteristics that define future activity.

## Time Series Modeling

In some cases, data relates to time, and specific predictive analytics rely on the relationship between what happens when. These types of models assess inputs at specific frequencies such as daily, weekly, or monthly iterations.

Then, analytical models can seek seasonality, trends, or behavioral patterns based on timing.

This type of predictive model is useful to predict when peak customer service periods are needed or when specific sales can be expected to jump.



## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics are brief informational coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire population or a sample of a population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread).
